# 🔥 Firewall Rule Generator

This tool allows you to create basic `iptables` firewall rules by specifying:
- ✅ Allowed TCP ports
- ❌ Blocked IP addresses

## 💡 How It Works
- Accepts user input for ports to allow (e.g. 22, 80)
- Accepts IPs to block (e.g. 192.168.1.5)
- Outputs bash-ready `iptables` rules

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python firewall_generator.py
```

Then follow the prompt and copy the generated rules to your terminal or firewall script.
